## CDG(Chrome Dino Game)
We designed a Chrome Dino Game with 'Canvas' and '2D'. CDG has the option of two different screen sizes. If window.innerWidth is greater than 1000, it's for desktop mode. Other screen sizes refer to mobile mode. To play the mobile and computer versions of the game, CDG allows players to use click and space for jumping motion. Also, each game speed will increase every 10 seconds for not losing a game. Computer play mode has a wider game size than mobile mode for comfortable play. And the smaller size of the game will help mobile users see on the phone. To give more life to dinosaurs and pterosaurs, we set up two images to look like running dinosaurs and flying pterosaurs. Dinosaurs and pterosaurs are in the loop for checking colition, but the cloud is in another loop since it doesn't need to pass through colition.
